🎬 Movie Search App

A simple and responsive web app to search for movies and series using the OMDb API. It allows users to:

- Search for movies/series by title
- Filter by type (movie or series)
- View detailed information in a modal
- Add movies to a favorites list stored in local storage
- Toggle light/dark mode
- Navigate results with pagination

📦 Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure
- `style.css` – App styling (light/dark theme support)
- `app.js` – App logic (API fetching, modals, favorites, etc.)
- `videography.png`, `bk.jpg`, `moon.png`, `sun.png` – Assets (ensure these are in the same directory)

🔧 Setup

1. Sign up at [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) to get your free API key.
2. Replace the placeholder API key (`704e8fb4`) in `app.js` with your own for production.
3. Clone or download the repository.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.
